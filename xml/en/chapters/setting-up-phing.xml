  <title>Setting-Up Phing</title>

  <para>The goal of this chapter is to help you obtain and correctly setup and
  execute Phing on your operating system. Once you setup Phing properly you
  shouldn't need to revisit this chapter, unless you're re-installing or
  moving your installation to another platform.</para>

  <section>
    <title>System Requirements</title>

    <para>To use Phing you must have installed PHP version 5.2 or above
    compiled <code>--with-libxml2</code>, as well as <code>--with-xsl</code>
    if you want to make use of advanced functionality.</para>

    <para>For more information on PHP and the required modules see the PHP
    <xref linkend="bibliography.php" /> website. For a brief list of software
    dependencies see below.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Operating Systems</title>

      <para>Designed for portability from the get go, Phing runs on all
      platforms that run PHP. However some advanced functionality may not work
      properly or is simply ignored on some platforms (i.e. chmod on the
      Windows platform).</para>

      <para>To get the most out of Phing, a Unix style platform is
      recommended. Namely: Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Software Dependencies</title>

      <para>For a detailed list of required / optional sofware and libraries,
      refer to the following table of Software Dependencies.</para>

      <para>NB: This list is not exhaustive, please refer to individual Phing
      tasks to find out additional software requirements.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Obtaining Phing</title>

    <para>Phing is free software distributed under the terms of the
    LGPL.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Distribution Files</title>

      <para>There are several ways to get a Phing distribution package. If you
      do not want to participate in developing Phing itself it is recommended
      that you get the latest snapshot or stable packaged distribution. If you
      are interested in helping with Phing development, get a CVS revision of
      the files, as described below.</para>

      <para>The easiest way to obtain the distribution package is to visit the
      Phing website <xref linkend="bibliography.phing" /> and download the
      current distribution package in the format you desire. </para>

      <para>As of version 2.0, you have the option of downloading a
      PEAR-installable package or the full phing distribution. If you wish to
      modify phing we suggestion downloading the full version so that you can
      (e.g.) create your own PEAR package. If you simply wish to use Phing for
      your own project or need it to build another package, download &amp;
      install the PEAR package.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Getting A Development Copy From Subversion</title>

      <para>You are encouraged to contibute to the development of Phing. If
      you want to participate or if you are simply interested in the latest
      features and development, obtain a Subversion copy as described in the
      following paragraphs.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">The SVN revisions of Phing are not
      bullet-proof and may fail to execute properly on your machine. Only
      obtain the development versions if you are absolutely aware of
      limitations and constraints of such an action. Additionally you should
      sign up to the development mailinglist to report and notice errors and
      incompatibilities.</emphasis></para>

      <para>We assume that you are running a Unix style operating system. So
      we expect the Subversion software is installed ant the svn executable is
      in your system's search path. However, the steps for a Windows based
      system are very similar. There is plenty additional information
      available on how to use Subversion <xref
      linkend="bibliography.svnhowto" />.</para>

      <para>To check out the project source repository type:</para>

      <screen>$&gt; svn checkout http://svn.phing.info/trunk</screen>

      <para>You can also browse the entire Phing source (including previous
      versions and development branches) on <link
      xlink:href="http://www.phing.info/trac/browser">http://www.phing.info/trac/browser</link>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>PEAR Install</title>

    <para>The easiest way to install Phing is using the PEAR installer.
    Provided that the package you downloaded is a the PEAR-ready package, you
    can install Phing simply from the command line (Unix or Windows):</para>

    <screen>$&gt; pear channel-discover pear.phing.info
$&gt; pear install phing/phing</screen>

    <para>The pear installer will check any dependencies and place the phing
    script (phing or phing.bat) into your PHP script directoy (i.e. where the
    "pear" script resides).</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Non-PEAR Install</title>

    <para>If you are not using the PEAR installer, you will need to setup your
    environment in order to run Phing. The distribution of Phing consists of
    three directories: bin , docs and classes. Only the bin, classes and etc
    directories are required to run Phing. To install Phing, choose a
    directory and uncompress the distribution file in that directory (you may
    already have done this in a prior step). This directory will be known as
    PHING_HOME .</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">On earlier Windows installations, the script
    used to launch Phing will have problems if PHING_HOME is a long filepath.
    This is due to limitations in the OS's handling of the "for" batch-file
    statement. It is recommended, therefore, that Phing be installed in a
    short path, such as C:\opt\phing.</emphasis></para>

    <para>Before you can run Phing there is some additional set up you will
    need to do perform:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Add the full path to the bin/ directory to your path.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Set the PHING_HOME environment variable to the directory where
        you installed Phing. On some operating systems the Phing wrapper
        scripts can guess PHING_HOME (Unix dialects and Windows). However, it
        is better to not rely on this behavior.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Set the PHP_COMMAND environment variable to where your Php
        binary is located (including the binary i.e.
        PHP_COMMAND=/usr/bin/php).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Set the PHP_CLASSPATH environment variable (see the section
        below). This should be set at least point to PHING_HOME/classes.
        Alternatively, you can also just add the phing/classes directory to
        your PHP include_path ini setting.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Check your php.ini file to make sure that you have the following
        settings:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>max_execution_time = 0 // unlimited execution time</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>memory_limit = 32M // you may need more memory depending on
            size of your build files</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If you are using Phing in conjunction with another application, you
    may need to add additional paths to PHP_CLASSPATH.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Unix</title>

      <para>Assuming you are running a Unix dialect operating system with the
      bash bourne shell and Phing is installed in /opt/phing . The following
      sets up the environment properly:</para>

      <screen>export PHP_COMMAND=/usr/bin/php
export PHING_HOME=/opt/phing
export PHP_CLASSPATH=${PHING_HOME}/classes
export PATH=${PATH}:${PHING_HOME}/bin</screen>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Windows</title>

      <para>On the Windows platfrom, assuming Phing is installed in
      c:\opt\phing. The following sets up your environment:</para>

      <para><screen>set PHP_COMMAND=c:\opt\php\php.exe
set PHING_HOME=c:\opt\phing
set PHP_CLASSPATH=c:\opt\phing\classes
set PATH=%PATH%;%PHING_HOME%\bin</screen></para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Advanced</title>

      <para>There are lots of variants that can be used to run/prepare Phing.
      You need at least the following:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you want Phing to be able to use other packages / classes,
          you can either add them to the PHP_CLASSPATH or to PHP's
          include_path.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Some Tasks in phing/tasks/ext may require 3rd party libraries
          to be installed. Generally, tools with compatible license (and
          stable releases) are included in phing/lib so that outside
          dependencies can be avoided. PEAR libs will not, however, be bundled
          with Phing since they are generally bundled with PHP. If you are
          using a 3rd party task, see the Task documentation to be aware of
          any dependencies.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>You are now ready to use the phing command at your command prompt,
      from everywhere in your directory tree.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Calling Phing</title>

    <para>Now you are prepared to execute Phing on the command line or via
    script files. The following section briefly describe how to properly
    execute phing.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Command Line</title>

      <para>Phing execution on the command line is simple. Just change to the
      directory where your buildfile resides and type</para>

      <screen>$ phing [targetname]</screen>

      <para>at the command line <emphasis>(where <code>[targetname]</code> is
      the target you want to be executed)</emphasis>. Optionally, you may
      specify command line arguments as listed in <xref
      linkend="phing.factheet" />.</para>

      <para>For example, the following command line calls the default
      buildscript <filename>build.xml</filename> using the default target with
      the propery <varname>ftp.upload</varname> set to true.</para>

      <para><screen>$ phing -Dftp.upload=true</screen></para>
